## 🚀 Installation

### 📦 From PyPI (Recommended)

You can install it using pip:

*   **Core Model Only:** Installs only the essential dependencies required to use the `GotenNet` model.
    ```bash
    pip install gotennet
    ```

*   **Full Installation (Core + Training/Utilities):** Installs core dependencies plus libraries needed for training, data handling, logging, etc.
    ```bash
    pip install gotennet[full]
    ```

### 🔧 From Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sarpaykent/gotennet.git
    cd gotennet
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (using conda or venv/uv):
    ```bash
    # Using conda
    conda create -n gotennet python=3.10
    conda activate gotennet

    # Or using venv/uv
    uv venv --python 3.10
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the package:**
    Choose the installation type based on your needs:

    *   **Core Model Only:** Installs only the essential dependencies required to use the `GotenNet` model.
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```

    *   **Full Installation (Core + Training/Utilities):** Installs core dependencies plus libraries needed for training, data handling, logging, etc.
        ```bash
        pip install .[full]
        # Or for editable install:
        # pip install -e .[full]
        ```
    *(Note: `uv` can be used as a faster alternative to `pip` for installation, e.g., `uv pip install .[full]`)*

## 🔬 Usage

### Using the Model

Once installed, you can import and use the `GotenNet` model directly in your Python code:

```python
from gotennet import GotenNet

# --- Using the base GotenNet model ---
# Requires manual calculation of edge_index, edge_diff, edge_vec

# Example instantiation 
model = GotenNet(
    n_atom_basis=256,
    n_interactions=4,
    # resf of the parameters
)

# Encoded representations can be computed with
h, X = model(atomic_numbers, edge_index, edge_diff, edge_vec) 

# --- Using GotenNetWrapper (handles distance calculation) ---
# Expects a PyTorch Geometric Data object or similar dict
# with keys like 'z' (atomic_numbers), 'pos' (positions), 'batch'

# Example instantiation
from gotennet import GotenNetWrapper
wrapped_model = GotenNetWrapper(
    n_atom_basis=256,
    n_interactions=4,
    # rest of the parameters
)

# Encoded representations can be computed with
h, X = wrapped_model(data) 

```

### Loading Pre-trained Models Programmatically

You can easily load pre-trained `GotenModel` instances programmatically using the `from_pretrained` class method. This method can accept a model alias (which will be resolved to a download URL), a direct HTTPS URL to a checkpoint file, or a local file path. It handles automatic downloading and caching of checkpoints. Pre-trained model weights and aliases are hosted on the [GotenNet Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/sarpaykent/GotenNet).

```python
from gotennet.models import GotenModel

# Example 1: Load by model alias 
# This will automatically download from a known location if not found locally.
# The format is {dataset}_{size}_{target}
model_by_alias = GotenModel.from_pretrained("QM9_small_homo") 

# Example 2: Load from a direct URL
model_url = "https://huggingface.co/sarpaykent/GotenNet/resolve/main/pretrained/qm9/small/gotennet_homo.ckpt" # Replace with an actual URL
model_by_url = GotenModel.from_pretrained(model_url)

# Example 3: Load from a local file path
local_model_path = "/path/to/your/local_model.ckpt" 
model_by_path = GotenModel.from_pretrained(local_model_path)

# After loading, the model is ready for inference:
predictions = model_by_alias(data_input) 
```

For more advanced scenarios, if you only need to load the base `GotenNet` representation module from a local checkpoint (e.g., a checkpoint that only contains representation weights), you can use:

```python
from gotennet import GotenNet, GotenNetWrapper

# Example: Load a GotenNet representation from a local file
representation_checkpoint_path = "/path/to/your/local_model.ckpt" 
gotennet_model = GotenNet.load_from_checkpoint(representation_checkpoint_path)
# or
gotennet_wrapped = GotenNetWrapper.load_from_checkpoint(representation_checkpoint_path)
```

### Training a Model

After installation, you can use the `train_gotennet` command:

```bash
train_gotennet
```

Or you can run the training script directly:

```bash
python gotennet/scripts/train.py
```

Both methods use Hydra for configuration. You can reproduce U0 target prediction on the QM9 dataset with the following command:

```bash
train_gotennet experiment=qm9_u0.yaml
```

### Testing a Model

To evaluate a trained model, you can use the `test_gotennet` script. When you provide a checkpoint, the script can infer necessary configurations (like dataset and task details) directly from the checkpoint file. This script leverages the `GotenModel.from_pretrained` capabilities, allowing you to specify the model to test by its alias, a direct URL, or a local file path, handling automatic downloads.

Here's how you can use it:

```bash
# Option 1: Test by model alias (e.g., QM9_small_homo)
# The script will automatically download the checkpoint and infer configurations.
test_gotennet checkpoint=QM9_small_homo

# Option 2: Test with a direct checkpoint URL
# The script will automatically download the checkpoint and infer configurations.
test_gotennet checkpoint=https://huggingface.co/sarpaykent/GotenNet/resolve/main/pretrained/qm9/small/gotennet_homo.ckpt

# Option 3: Test with a local checkpoint file path
test_gotennet checkpoint=/path/to/your/local_model.ckpt
```

The script uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for any additional or overriding configurations if needed, but for straightforward evaluation of a checkpoint, only the `checkpoint` argument is typically required.

### Configuration

The project uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for configuration management. Configuration files are located in the `configs/` directory.

Main configuration categories:
- `datamodule`: Dataset configurations (md17, qm9, etc.)
- `model`: Model configurations
- `trainer`: Training parameters
- `callbacks`: Callback configurations
- `logger`: Logging configurations
